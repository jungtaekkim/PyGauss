Description
###########

This Python module implements existing approaches, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes, to sample from  high-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions. The latter can be divided into two groups, namely:

- matrix splitting approaches,
- data augmentation approaches.

For more details, we refer the interested reader to Section 4 of the companion paper.
